# User manual for the clock

The user manual describes:
- The two modes it has.
- How to change the date and time on the clock
- The functions of each button.

## Modes

There two different states or modes for the clock:
- *Display clock mode*: in this mode the clock updates date and time periodically.
- *Edition mode*: clock enters in this mode when the user clicks the *edit* button. Here the user can edit the
date, time and day of the week. To **exit** this mode, the user has to loop through each parameter, by clicking the *edit*
button. Only after reaching the last parameter, clock goes back to *Display clock mode*.

## Buttons

There are two buttons: *edit* and *set*.
The *edit* button allows user to go into *Edition mode*. Inside this mode, user can loop through each paramter of the
date and time to edit their values.

The *set* button only works when clock is in *Edition mode*. With this button the user can set the value for the
selected parameter.
